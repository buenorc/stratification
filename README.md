 
# Vertical stratification generator (with GUI) 

  

## Create an initial vertical profile of constituents (e.g., temperature, salinity, pollutants and tracers) to use as data input for Delft3d numerical model  

### This program in the current stage only works to create a temperature stratification; further tests must be conducted to check if it works for other constituents too. 

The algorithm requires as input data the following information:  

1) pair of integers related to the number of grid points in m- and n- direction (same integer name specified in mdf file)  
2) a text file indicating the profile of each activated constituent (profile must be specified from  

The program generates an output file, ***stratification.ini***, that can be used in the Delft3D model. 
The input file must be specified in the Delf3D: Flow > Flow input > Initial conditions. In the dropdown list, you must select ***Initial conditions file*** and specify the file generated by the program.  

PS 1: Make sure that the activated constituent has been activated in Delft3D. For example, if you wish to create an initial temperature profile, make sure that Temperature is selected in Flow > Flow input > Processes > Constituents.  

PS 2: Make sure that the pair of integers specified in the program correspond with the values displayed in the .mdf file   

To run the code, the user must have installed the following packages in a Python interpreter: 
1) Numpy
2) Tkinter (for the GUI)

To install Python, the
